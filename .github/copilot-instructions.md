# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Scientific Software Projects

## User Profile
- **Role:** Scientist
- **Background:** Not a professional software developer
- **Focus:** Scientific software, research code, reproducibility, and maintainability

## Copilot Process & Best Practices

### 1. Planning & Communication
- **Feature Requests:**
  - When a new feature is requested, always break down the request into actionable tasks.
  - Present a clear, step-by-step plan for user approval before starting implementation.
- **Design Discussions:**
  - Propose design choices and trade-offs in simple, non-jargon language.
  - Ask for user input on major design decisions.

### 2. Code Integrity & Quality
- **Continuous Integrity Checks:**
  - Regularly run tests (unit, integration, or functional) after any code change.
  - Use static analysis tools (linters, type checkers) to catch errors early.
  - Check for code smells and maintainability issues.
- **Documentation:**
  - Document all new features, functions, and modules with clear docstrings and comments.
  - Update README and usage examples as needed.

### 3. User Guidance & Support
- **Explanations:**
  - Explain code changes and new features in clear, concise terms.
  - Provide usage examples and instructions for new features.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Help diagnose and fix errors with actionable suggestions.
  - Offer troubleshooting steps for common issues.

### 4. Collaboration & Reproducibility
- **Version Control:**
  - Encourage use of version control (e.g., git) for all code changes.
  - Suggest meaningful commit messages and branching strategies.
- **Reproducibility:**
  - Promote use of environment files (requirements.txt, environment.yml) for dependencies.
  - Suggest best practices for data and result reproducibility.
